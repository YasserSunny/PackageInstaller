# PackageInstaller

# Description

You suddenly have a curious aspiration to create a package installer that can handle dependencies. You want to be able to give the installer a list of packages with dependencies, and have it install the packages in order such that an install won’t fail due to a missing dependency. This exercise is to write the code that will determine the order of install.

# Requirements
* Please complete the exercise in either C# or Javascript.
* Please use Test Driven Development (TDD) and include your tests.
* Please submit your code in a git repo (zipped and emailed, not on github) where you have committed throughout the process so that
we can see your progress as you code the solution.
* The program should accept an array of strings defining packages and their dependencies. Each string contains the name of a package
followed by a colon and space then any dependencies required by that package. For simplicity we’ll assume that a package can have
at most one dependency.
* The program should reject as invalid a dependency specification that contains cycles.
* The program should output a comma separated string of package names in the order of install, such that a package’s dependency will
always precede that package.
